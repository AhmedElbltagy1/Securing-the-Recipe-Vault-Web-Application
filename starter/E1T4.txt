Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.
-------------------
# Poor practice 1
-------------------
Allowing network traffic from all ports in the public and private subnet
Solution:
Network ACL (Access Control List) rules must be applied to control the inbound and outbound traffic. 
This will minimize the risks of malicious activities on the server or infrastructure by attackers.
-------------------
# Poor practice 2
-------------------
Poor or no IAM Role and Policy which is giving access to all the users to access both buckets (free and secret recipes).
Solution: 
Proper IAM Role and Policy should be defined and implemented with specific roles to allow the users 
from the internet gateway to access the free recipes bucket and not the secret recipes bucket.
